Project Title: Travel Trailer Insurance Policy Marketing Strategy

Abstract

With the air travel vacation option wiped out since the COVID-19 pandemic began, people seek out safe ways to escape their homes. It has reportedly been a record summer for travel trailer sales. With the surge in the sales, there are huge opportunities in the travel trailer insurance market and there is a need for insurance companies to gear themselves up with marketing strategies in terms of identifying target customers and improving product offerings to better position themselves in the market. Based on the context above, the problems that I propose are as follows:
  1.	How to predict potential buyers of travel trailer insurance policies
  2.	What to suggest for the potential buyers of travel trailer insurance policies
Various classification techniques will be used to understand which demographic factors would be found from people who buy travel trailer insurance policies. Determining the demographic factors is key to predict who will buy travel trailer insurance policies. Moreover, the pattern mining technique using the association rule will be used to extract the combination of insurance policies people tend to buy. Based on the pattern, potential product bundle offerings can be identified. The dataset is available at the following link: it contains socio-demographic data and insurance product usage data derived based on postal codes. In order to solve the research problem, Python will be used throughout the project cycle including data exploration, data cleaning, model building and results presentation.
